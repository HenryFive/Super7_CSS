		<br><br>
		<font color="#fff">SuperSeven</font><font color="#7ebe45">Studio</font> Photo – Video Production is a family business with a team of Professional Photographers, Videographers and support staff dedicated to serve our clients by producing the highest quality photographic images and videos possible. The studio is located in Bohol, a first class island province of the Philippines. Areas of the team's photographic expertise include Weddings, Engagements and Debut Celebrations.
		<br><br>
		The team was fostered through the efforts of their uncle and aunt. Their uncle started his photography years back in Hawaii in early 1990's and decided to bring his business to his home land.
		<br><br>
		For then he shared his knowledge and skills to his nephews. He tried to explain and elaborate more on the things that we need to focus, "preserving memories". Given the drive of excitement to know how a business runs, we then applied our learning's to real life. Without hesitations, we then tried to shoot a big day way back in 2006. From then we are moved with highly deep feelings in a way a special day flows. From its various emotions, ambiance, people and many more reasons why we love what we are doing; capturing memories.
		<br><br>
		Bohol is one of the wedding destinations of the country. A good place to tie yourself to someone you love. A great reason to put up a business with a name SUPERSEVEN - a team that's composed of young talents.  On hand are state of the art technology and highest quality equipments.
		<br><br>
		We get to know our clients and meet with you before your production session or wedding day so we become a good fit for one another.  Our style is distinctive, natural, and spur out of the moment, capturing those special moments of bliss and delight on your wedding day or your child's giggle during a portrait production. 
		<br><br>
		What made us unique with other suppliers in Bohol?
		<br><br>
		Many photographers apply the same methodology to every project - and their images stare it. But with <font color="#fff">SuperSeven</font><font color="#7ebe45">Studio</font>, we don't follow the conventional flow of an event, we capture it in an artistic manner.
